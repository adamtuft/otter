# Otter

Developed under the [ExCALIBUR task parallelism cross-cutting research theme](https://excalibur.ac.uk/projects/exposing-parallelism-task-parallelism/), Otter is a tool designed to facilitate data-driven parallelisation of serial code. Otter allows HPC developers to:

- Annotate, trace & visualise loop/task-based serial code as a directed graph;
- Recommend strategies for transforming serial code into effective task-based parallel code;
- Non-invasively trace & visualise loop/task-based OpenMP 5.x programs.

The [project wiki](https://github.com/Otter-Taskification/otter/wiki) introduces the Otter toolset and explains how to use the features above. Otter can trace and visualise the structure of serial and OpenMP code, for example transforming the following code:

```c
int fibonacci(int n) {
    int i, j;
    if (n<2) return n;
    #pragma omp task shared(i) firstprivate(n)
        i = f(n-1);
    #pragma omp task shared(j) firstprivate(n)
        j = f(n-2);
    #pragma omp taskwait
    return i+j;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int n = atoi(argv[1]);
    #pragma omp parallel shared(n)
    {
        #pragma omp single
        printf("f(%d) = %d\n", n, f(n));
    }
}
```

Into a directed graph visualising the code's task creation and synchronisation structure:

The nodes of this graph represent the different tasking constructs that Otter can show:

## Otter Toolset

The Otter toolset includes:

- [**Otter-Serial**](https://github.com/Otter-Taskification/otter/wiki/Otter-Serial): an API and runtime library for annotating & tracing the structure of a serial target application.
<!-- -  in order to facilitate data-driven parallelisation of the target. -->
- [**Otter-OMPT**](https://github.com/Otter-Taskification/otter/wiki/Otter-OMPT): an OMPT tool for non-invasive tracing of the loop/task-based structure of OpenMP 5.x programs.
<!-- - , allowing HPC developers to observe OpenMP program structure from the perspective of the OpenMP runtime. -->
- [**PyOtter**](https://github.com/Otter-Taskification/otter/wiki/PyOtter): The visualisation & reporting tool for use with Otter trace data.
